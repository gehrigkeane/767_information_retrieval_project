lost tiebreaker playoff game to the bears, which dropped them to 3rd place (by winning percentage). the tiebreaker game was considered a regular season game, so 3rd place at 6-2-4 is the spartan's final standing. due to a strike-shortened season in 1982, all teams were ranked by conference instead of division. see also edit history of the detroit lions v t e detroit lions formerly the  portsmouth spartans founded in 1930 based in  detroit michigan headquartered in  allen park michigan franchise franchise history seasons players first-round draft picks starting quarterbacks coaches stadiums universal stadium university of detroit stadium tiger stadium silverdome ford field culture nfl on thanksgiving day paper lion film home improvement thanksgiving lore 1932 playoff game the curse of bobby layne mike utley gives a thumbs up taking the wind fire millen 016 calvin johnson rule miracle in motown rivalries chicago bears green bay packers minnesota vikings notable people william clay martha firestone ford barry sanders bobby layne glenn presnell league championships (4) 1935 1952 1953 1957 current league affiliations league:  national football league conference:  national football conference division:  north division broadcasters radio detroit lions radio network dan miller jim brandstatter tony ortiz wjr tv detroit lions television network matt shepard rob rubick nate burleson jennifer hammond wjbk fox sports detroit seasons (87) 1930s 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940s 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950s 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960s 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970s 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980s 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990s 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000s 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010s 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 v t e portsmouth spartans/detroit lions seasons 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 bold nfl championship super bowl v t e nfl team season lists american football conference afc east afc north afc south afc west buffalo bills miami dolphins new england patriots new york jets baltimore ravens cincinnati bengals cleveland browns pittsburgh steelers houston texans indianapolis colts jacksonville jaguars tennessee titans denver broncos kansas city chiefs oakland raiders san diego chargers national football conference nfc east nfc north nfc south nfc west dallas cowboys new york giants philadelphia eagles washington redskins chicago bears detroit lions green bay packers minnesota vikings atlanta falcons carolina panthers new orleans saints tampa bay buccaneers arizona cardinals los angeles rams san francisco 49ers seattle seahawks https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=list_of_detroit_lions_seasons oldid=703709207 categories detroit lions seasons national football league teams seasons detroit, michigan-related lists navigation menu personal tools not logged in talk contributions create account log in namespaces article talk variants views read edit view history more search navigation main page contents featured content current events random article donate to wikipedia wikipedia store interaction help about wikipedia community portal recent changes contact page tools what links here related changes upload file special pages permanent link page information wikidata item cite this page print/export create a book download as pdf printable version languages italiano edit links text is available under the  creative commons attribution-sharealike license terms of use privacy policy wikimedia foundation, inc. privacy policy about wikipedia disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view
