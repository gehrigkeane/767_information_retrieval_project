0051201,It's Britain 1953. Upon his return to work following a heart attack irrepressible barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts known as a barrister for the hopeless takes on a murder case much to the exasperation of his medical team led by his overly regulated private nurse Miss Plimsoll who tries her hardest to ensure that he not return to his hard living ways - including excessive cigar smoking and drinking - while he takes his medication and gets his much needed rest. That case is defending American war veteran Leonard Vole a poor out of work struggling inventor who is accused of murdering his fifty-six year old lonely and wealthy widowed acquaintance Emily French. The initial evidence is circumstantial but points to Leonard as the murderer. Despite being happily married to East German former beer hall performer Christine Vole he fostered that friendship with Mrs. French in the hopes that she would finance one of his many inventions to the tune of a few hundred pounds. It thus does not help his case when it is learned that Mrs. French changed her will prior to her murder with Leonard being the primary beneficiary of a £80000 estate. Leonard states that he knew nothing about the will. Christine is apparently the only alibi Leonard has to his whereabouts at the time of the murder. The usual methods Sir Wilfrid uses to test his clients' guilt or innocence leads to him believing that Leonard is indeed innocent. As the trial progresses the prosecution calls a surprise witness one that could place a nail in the coffin of Sir Wilfrid's planned line of defense. As Sir Wilfrid gets deeper and deeper into the case something doesn't quite sit right with him although he doesn't know what it is. The primary questions become how far Sir Wilfrid will go to obtain evidence to acquit Leonard and if he will ever discover why he feels that there is something odd about the case.,

1596363,Three separate but parallel stories of the U.S mortgage housing crisis of 2005 are told. Michael Burry an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager has traded traditional office attire for shorts bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play they decide to call an old 'friend' retired investment banker Ben Rickert to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on while for them to win the general economy has to lose which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined which in turn may throw curves into the process.,
