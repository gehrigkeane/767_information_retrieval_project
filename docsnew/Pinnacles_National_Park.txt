km) to the northwest. it is believed that the pinnacles came from this particular volcano due to the unique  breccias 43 andesite rhyolite fault block 44 large-scale earth movement also created the  talus shear fractures 43 since the pinnacles were moved to this area, the san andreas fault has shifted 4 miles (6.4 km) to the east of the park. the original location of the san andreas can be seen in the chalone creek fault. two other large faults are known to run through the park, the miner's gulch and pinnacles faults. these faults parallel the san andreas and were most likely caused by major movements of the main fault. 43 plate tectonics 44 seismic united states geological survey seismometers 43 ecology edit resolution adjustable pdf map animals edit prairie falcons california condor 45

bears 49 like many parks in central california, pinnacles has had a small problem with wild  pigs domestic pigs wild boars national park service km) around the center core of the park. outside this fence, however, wild pigs still roam in regular abundance. current monitoring for potential breaks and breaches in the fence is needed to ensure that the pigs do not return to devastate the park. 50 thirteen species of bats have been documented at pinnacles, with a further three species considered likely. the park's talus caves provide roosting and breeding habitat for the bats. 51 in the 1990s a student biologist, olivia messinger, did a census of bees at pinnacles. she found that the park has more bees per unit area than we know of, anywhere else on earth, around 400 species. most of these bees are solitary bees, not living in colonies like european honeybees, and most live for only three to four weeks. and since flowers bloom here throughout the growing season, there are many niches for all the bee species. an interesting five-minute video is found at sfnps.org/bees  52 vegetation edit in the warmer portions of the park, large areas of  greasewood manzanita gray pine canyon live

until 2013 as the pinnacles wilderness). wilderness designation provides even higher protection for the rock spires that give pinnacles its name, as well as south chalone peak, the second highest peak in the park. the wilderness includes the creeks and canyons that are habitat for the endangered  red-legged frog 54 united states congress public law national wilderness preservation system 55 activities edit although roads approach the park from the west through soledad and from the east through empty lands south of hollister, the roads do not connect in the park. most of the developed areas are on the east side of the park. 56 there are several trails for day hikers, some of which are strenuous. primarily in march and april, a wide variety of wildflowers is on display, except in years of extreme drought. the trails provide views of the surrounding hills and valleys on clear days. the san andreas fault is visible from some vantages along the trails. the park includes a well known hiking portion known among enthusiasts simply as "the pig fence". this portion of south wilderness trail is a challenging stretch of strenuous hiking that at times requires use of the fence, erected to prevent feral pigs from entering the park, to help oneself to climb the steeply pitched trail. other trails include lush wildflower accented views along flat stream beds, trails that bring one into beautiful caves, and trails that involve high vistas of the pinnacle formations. the park is popular with advanced rock climbers due to the many difficult and challenging climbs. 57 the caves at pinnacles are  talus caves 58 townsend's big-eared bat 59 camping facilities are available on the east side in the pinnacles campground. 60 see also edit state route 25 state route 146 tres pinos,
